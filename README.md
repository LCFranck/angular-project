# Learning angular project

The purpose of thius project is for me to learn Angular. What i currently have is very minimal with only a footer, header and homepage. Will continue working on it when I have free time.

This project was made by partially following the tutorial found [here](https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/01-hello-world)

Its not that pretty right now and the database is just a json file, will continue to learn and improve.
